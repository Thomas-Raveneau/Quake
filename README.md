# Quake (remake)

Remake of the classic video game from the 90s. This FPS game will allow you to play online with your friends, the goal being to eliminate your opponents as many times as possible in the allotted time. To do this, you will have at your disposal 2 different weapons, a rocket launcher and a laser gun. Your knowledge of the map will make the difference between victory or defeat by recovering the various bonuses distributed throughout the map at the right time. To your weapons and enjoy!
